I am a software engineer from [Berlin, Germany](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Berlin/@52.5069312,13.1445498,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47a84e373f035901:0x42120465b5e3b70!8m2!3d52.5200066!4d13.404954){:target="_blank"}. I enjoy learning and applying my knowledge in product and platform engineering, particularly in backend development, distributed systems and infrastructure.
